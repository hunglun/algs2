*  TESTING CORRECTNESS
********************************************************************************

Testing correctness of BoggleSolver
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Tests 1-9 create one BoggleSolver object corresponding to the specified
dictionary and call getAllValidWords() with several different boards
as arguments.

Running 13 total tests.

Test 1: check getAllValidWords() on two fixed 4-by-4 boards given in assignment
  * dictionary = dictionary-algs4.txt; board = board4x4.txt
  * dictionary = dictionary-algs4.txt; board = board-q.txt
==> passed

Test 2: check getAllValidWords() on fixed 4-by-4 boards
  * dictionary = dictionary-yawl.txt; board = board4x4.txt
  * dictionary = dictionary-yawl.txt; board = board-points1.txt
  * dictionary = dictionary-yawl.txt; board = board-points2.txt
  * dictionary = dictionary-yawl.txt; board = board-points3.txt
  * dictionary = dictionary-yawl.txt; board = board-points4.txt
  * dictionary = dictionary-yawl.txt; board = board-points5.txt
==> passed

Test 3: check getAllValidWords() on more fixed 4-by-4 boards
  * dictionary = dictionary-yawl.txt; board = board-points100.txt


Total: 0/13 tests passed: Could not complete tests, which results in a reported score of 0.
